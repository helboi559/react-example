- Create a new github repo called reactexample, clone the repo to your computer and add the link to populi
- cd into the local repo folder, /reactexample, and run 'npx create-react-app ." inside of it.
  - If you see the message "Need to install the following packages: create-react-app" enter "y"
  - If the terminal tells you to run "npm uninstall -g create-react-app" run the following two commands:
    - sudo npm uninstall -g create-react-app
    - npx clear-npx-cache
  - If you did it right, you should see npm installing packages and then finally the message "happy hacking"
- Check that React installed properly by running 'npm start' in the folder and navigating to localhost:3000. You should see the basic react page.
- Write a new React component called MyInfoComponent, add three variables inside the component for your name, favoriteColor and favoriteMovies which should be an array of 3 movie titles and display them in the component JSX.
- Add this new component to the JSX of <App> to see your component render to the page.

* Move the three variables you just created into the MyInfoComponent state via the React useState hook. The three state variables should still display on the page.
* Add three text input fields to the page.
* Add an onChange handler function to each text input field.
* Connect the setter function from React's useState hook to the event.target.value of the text input field. If you did it right, the state variables displayed to the page should update in real time as you type.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
